# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a fairly simple implementation of the game of ***"Rock Paper Scissors"*** wherein I have used technologies which could support the game on the browser without having the need to download and install runtime environments specifically for the game. Although the logic of the game should be relatively easy to implement; one could have the computer make its decision using the random method; I have implemented visually-appealing elements into the game such as the **icons** (free icons downloaded from *iconfinder* and the game counter.

> Technologies used - HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The application keeps track of the number of times the user wins, loses or draws the game. There is also a **reset** button at the very bottom that resets the score when clicked. The entire styling is done mostly externally using a CSS script file which is then linked to the HTML file using proper tags and properties. The logic of the game is written completely on JavaScript.


## How To Run

Download the project on to your system and extract the files in your desired location. Double click on the ***"index.html"*** file and you should be able to see the game running on your default browser. Since it is a client-side scripted application and the resources used in it are stored in the project structure, you don't need an active interent connection to run and play it.


## Ending Note

Developing simple games could become tricky sometimes when you are dealing with the frontend side of the application too. A little though of implementing a new feature or incorporating an element in your backend requires adding or editing already-set elements in your frontend. And that takes a lot of time to figure out and engineer. With this repository, I aim to bring forth the simple nuances of development which we tend to forget as we progress along our path of learning complex technological advancements. I really hope you enjoy this simple yet engaging game, and kindly let me know how you feel about it. Have a great day and have fun.

Happy Coding :)
